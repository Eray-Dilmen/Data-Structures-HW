/// The General Logic
/*
Iterate through all the nodes one by one.
If a node has not been visited yet, that node is the starting point of a new cluster.
Start from that node, traverse every reachable node, and mark them as visited (This forms one complete cluster).
Continue the loop; if you encounter another unvisited node, that indicates the start of a second cluster.

     ///  How is it distinguished
/*
The for loop inside the main function is the heart of the distinction process:
The loop starts from node 0.
It checks visited[0]. If it is 0 (unvisited), it means a new cluster has been found.
DFS(0) is called. This function visits 1 and 2 (which are connected to 0), marks all of them as visited = 1, and prints them.
When DFS finishes, the loop moves to node 1. However, since 1 was just visited (visited[1] == 1) during the previous step, the code skips it (It understands that it belongs to the previous cluster).
When the loop reaches node 3, it sees that visited[3] == 0. It realizes: "I could not reach this node in the previous rounds, so this must be a separate cluster (Cluster 2)."
It starts DFS(3) again and visits only 3 and 4.
Summary: The visited array and the if(visited[i] == 0) check are the boundaries that distinguish and separate the clusters from each other.
